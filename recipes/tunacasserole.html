        <li>1 1/2 tablespoons Kosher Salt</li>

        <li>1 package Dry Egg Noodles</li>
        <li>2 cans Tuna in Olive Oil</li>
        <li>3/4 cup frozen Peas</li>
        <li>1 pinch Cayenne Pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon Freshly Ground Black Pepper</li>

        <li>1/2 cup grated Permigiano-Reggiano Cheese</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Olive Oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly butter a 9x13-inch casserole dish.</li>
        <li>Melt 3 tablespoons butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Saute onion with 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt until it starts to soften up and turn translucent, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the flour, and cook, stirring, for 3 minutes, reducing heat if needed.</li>
        <li>Pour in cold milk and whisk for 1 minute. Raise heat to medium-high and cook, stirring often, until the sauce thickens and comes to a simmer. Remove from heat, whisk in Cheddar cheese, and reserve until needed.</li>
        <li>Fill a large pot with water and remaining salt and bring to a rapid boil. Cook egg noodles for 5 minutes. Drain well and add to a large mixing bowl. Stir in the reserved sauce, followed by tuna, peas, cayenne, black pepper, and Worcestershire sauce. Mix with a spatula until evenly combined.</li>
        <li>Pour the mixture into the prepared dish. Mix bread crumbs, Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, and olive oil together in a small bowl until combined and resembling wet sand. Sprinkle evenly over the casserole.</li>
        <li>Bake in the center of the preheated oven until browned and bubbly, about 30 minutes. Let sit for 10 minutes before cutting and serving.</li>
    </ol>
